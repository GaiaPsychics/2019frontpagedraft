</div><div>Here are 8 scientific ways to be happier (that have nothing to do with “positive thinking”)
</div><div>
</div><div>Like most things in life, happiness requires actual effort. There are difficult choices to be made in order to keep yourself happy, especially in the long run.
</div><div>
</div><div>There’s a quote by Buffer’s director for marketing, Kevan Lee, that I particularly like. In embodying happiness at Buffer, they’ve actually changed “customer support” to customer happiness. “Happiness is baked into our culture and values and the DNA of every person who works on the team,” Lee writes.
</div><div>
</div><div>This makes me wonder: is happiness bred in a culture or just inherent in specific human beings? I sought to find explanations on how happiness and how to seek it:
</div><div>
</div><div>1) Recognize Yourself For What You Are
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>We all know the saying, “You can be anything you want to be.” But really, there’s a much better way of saying it: “You can become better than who you currently are.”
</div><div>
</div><div>The process of positive affirmation doesn’t mean that you focus exclusively on positivity. In fact, psychologist Paul Pearsall’s version of this is called “openture”, where he encourages that we welcome flaws with the same zeal as strengths.
</div><div>
</div><div>Instead of pushing to become something we are not, we must simply acknowledge our flaws instead of pretending they don’t exist. A study conducted by the University of Waterloo found evidence that forcing positivity can only lead to greater discontent.
</div><div>
</div><div>The first step to happiness, then, is to forgive ourselves for the things we don’t like, and push forward with the things that we are proud of.
</div><div>
</div><div>2) Welcome The Complexity Of Life
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Life is a very complex thing, and the spectrum of human emotions is no less complicated.
</div><div>
</div><div>Psychologist Jonathan Adler performed a series of tests for a theory called mixed emotional experience. He theorized that people who welcomed positive and negative emotions simultaneously possessed an overall positive psychological well-being.
</div><div>
</div><div>True enough, participants who affirmed both of their bad and good feelings reported better moods. Adler says this is caused by a neutralization of two strong emotions: “Taking the good and the bad together may detoxify the bad experiences.”
</div><div>
</div><div>Similarly, a Boston University study affirms that anxiety can be overcome through the very acknowledgement of complex human emotions.
</div><div>
</div><div>Another study by Hal Hershfield even went as far to conclude that emotional balance helps to maintain one’s physique.
</div><div>
</div><div>There is a clear benefit from internalizing the good and the bad in human experiences, so don’t be afraid to embrace them.
</div><div>
</div><div>3) Always Expect The Worst
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>But isn’t that pessimism, you ask? Not really. This age-old practice of “negative visualization” or expecting the worst and preparing for it has been around since ancient Japan.
</div><div>
</div><div>In modern times, expert Oliver Burkeman described it as “the premeditation”: “In most situations, you’re going to discover that your anxiety or your fears about those situations were exaggeration.”
</div><div>
</div><div>Perhaps another modern-day testimony to the potential benefits of negative visualization is military training.
</div><div>
</div><div>Talking to a friend who was a previous Navy SEAL, he told me his superiors always challenged them because “the enemy won’t be any kinder.”
</div><div>
</div><div>By training for the worst, you can prepare for anything between the worst and the best possible situation.
</div><div>
</div><div>4) Be Physically Close To People You Love
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>It’s natural for us to feel happier when friends and family are around. Interestingly, there is now scientific proof on how proximity can influence happiness.
</div><div>
</div><div>An impressive study known as the Framingham Heart Study in Massachusetts studied participants, observing how happiness behaved across several generations.
</div><div>
</div><div>They found that happiness and proximity are affected by several factors, most prominently the kind of relationship they share with the other person.
</div><div>
</div><div>The study concluded that, of all relationships, mutual friends were perceived as the relationship that brings most happiness to the participants.
</div><div>
</div><div>Being near a family member didn’t fare as well, only ranking fifth for siblings. Interestingly, romantic relationships ranked fairly lower than mutual friendships, with co-resident partners ranking sixth and non-resident partners ranking eighth.
</div><div>
</div><div>So whenever you need a quick pick-me-up, try giving one of your good friends a call and see what happens.

</div><div>Delving into novelty can be a pretty scary thing. Needless to say, it packs a lot of stress. When we try to pick up a new skill, we often deal these with feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt, as is a natural response to exploring unfamiliar ground.
</div><div>
</div><div>A study published by the Journal of Happiness Studies suggests that this stress is good for you, at least for the long term.
</div><div>
</div><div>When you are making a conscious effort to improve your character by learning a new language or developing a weak trait, for example, you eventually become happier on a daily basis.
</div><div>
</div><div>Knowing that you are well on your way to becoming a more mature, more competent individual is a surefire way to boost happiness and foster confidence.
</div><div>
</div><div>6) Change The Way You Say No
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Countless work-life balance experts have claimed that turning down responsibilities is a definite step toward happiness. In other words, the quickest way to become happy is by knowing when to say no.
</div><div>
</div><div>But even when we do say no, we feel guilt for abandoning non-urgent responsibilities just because we’re already used to saying yes. The Journal of Consumer Research did an interesting take on the variation of saying no in understanding if terminology has anything to do with effectivity.
</div><div>
</div><div>Instead of saying no, the study found out that saying “I don’t” is a better affirmation for both taking up tasks and giving them up. Saying “I don’t miss family dinners for work” rather than “I won’t miss family dinners for work” is likelier to come true, making it a better mantra for any busy person in the world.
</div><div>
</div><div>7) Therapy Actually Works Better Than Money
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>While it’s not uncommon knowledge that therapy in itself works as a mood booster, it’s also commonly perceived that receiving material objects like money can produce equal amount of happiness.
</div><div>
</div><div>Apparently, this is not the case. In one recent study, it was found that thousands of subjects reported that receiving therapy was at least 32% more effective in boosting happiness than receiving cash.
</div><div>
</div><div>The study went on to conclude that non-material factors like experiences and relationships are better ways to increase happiness, as compared to material objects like possessions and money.
</div><div>
</div><div>Knowing how to change your life in order to become a happier person will pay off in the long run, even if it means forgoing temporary material objects in favor of long lasting life events.
</div><div>
</div><div>8) Participate In Pleasure Fasting
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>The principle of fasting is pretty simple. Some people participate in fasting as a part of their religious holidays (Ramadan, for example); others to induce a new way to burn calories (water fasting).
</div><div>
</div><div>But fasting can go beyond matters of food. Pleasure fasting is where you give up things that you would regularly enjoy: checking social media, indulgent sweets, a certain video game. The goal of pleasure fasting is to increase happiness on things we already enjoy.
</div><div>
</div><div>How? One psychologist explains this phenomenon perfectly well: “Denying yourself something makes you appreciate the things you take for granted.”
</div><div>
</div><div>When you engage in pleasure fasting, you will find your willpower becoming weaker throughout the day, but that isn’t really an indicator of weakness. You can easily train yourself to obey your mind as control becomes more elusive.
</div><div>
</div><div>In a way, pleasure fasting is one of the quickest ways to boost happiness. It challenges us to rethink the way we engage with current sources of happiness, and elevates our experience to these otherwise mundane interactions.

</div><div>Here's what you'll learn:
</div><div>
</div><div>• How and why to be mindful: There are many simple exercises you can do to bring a mindful attitude to quotidian activities such as eating breakfast, walking the dog, or sitting on the floor to stretch.
</div><div>
</div><div>• How to meditate: Many beginning meditators have a lot of questions: How should I sit? How long should I meditate? What if it feels awkward or uncomfortable or my foot falls asleep? Am I doing it wrong? In this book, you’ll find simple steps and explanations to answer these questions and demystify meditation. (And no, you’re not doing it wrong).
</div><div>
</div><div>• How to approach relationships: This section offers tips for interacting with friends and enemies alike and walks you through a loving kindness meditation.
</div><div>
</div><div>• How to minimize harm: There is a lot of suffering in the world; it’s best for everyone if we try not to add to it. Here you’ll read about the idea of ahimsa (non-harming) and how you might apply it to your actions.
</div><div>
</div><div>• How to let things go: As Buddhism teaches, excessive attachment (whether we’re clinging to something or actively resisting it) all too often leads to suffering. Practitioners of mindfulness meditation find peace in letting go and accepting things as they are in the&nbsp;</div></h3>
